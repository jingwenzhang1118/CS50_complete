# CS50 labs and problem sets

An computer science course taught by David J. Malan, CS50 teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. 

Here I include the codes I used to solve the questions of the *Practice problems*,  *labs*, and *Problem sets*. The original questions of each topic/week can be found on [CS50's website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). 

Please follow the course's policy on academic honesty when you work on your own codes.

# CS50_complete

An computer science course taught by David J. Malan, CS50 teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python and SQL, etc. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. 


Here I share the codes I used to solve the questions of the lab and problem sets. The original questions of each topic/week can be found on [CS50's website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). 


Please follow the course's policy on academic honesty when you work on your own codes.
